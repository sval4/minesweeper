<p>Starting Out:&nbsp; Begin by clicking randomly in the minefield until you get a decent amount of spaces cleared.&nbsp; If you hit a mine during this, you will lose.</p>
<p>The Numbers:&nbsp; A tile with a number on it means that there is a mine directly touching that space. The actual number on the space corresponds with how many mines it is touching. A tile can have up to 8 mines touching it:&nbsp; above it, below it, to the right of it, to the left of it, and all 4 diagonals. A cleared tile that doesn&rsquo;t have a number on it isn&rsquo;t touching a mine.</p>
<p>Flags: If you know for sure where a mine is, right click it and a flag will be placed on that space. The flag is simply to remind you that the mine is there. A tile that is flagged cannot be revealed unless it is unflagged by right-clicking&nbsp;the tile again.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>
